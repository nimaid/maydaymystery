# The Texts

This page is home to every known May Day Mystery ad or related scan. It includes the best quality scans available between [my own HD scans](https://github.com/nimaid/maydaymystery/blob/master/texts/My%20Scans/README.md) and [the original maydaymystery.org scans](https://github.com/nimaid/maydaymystery/blob/master/texts/maydaymystery.org/README.md).

I have obtained explicity written permission to publish these online by the copyright holder, The Daily Wildcat. They know Bryan Hance, and generally approve of anything that may help in solving this mystery.
