# All Of the Texts (WIP)

This page is home to every known May Day Mystery ad or related scan. It includes the best quality scans available between [my own HD scans](https://github.com/nimaid/maydaymystery/blob/master/texts/My%20Scans/README.md) and [the original maydaymystery.org scans](https://github.com/nimaid/maydaymystery/blob/master/texts/maydaymystery.org/README.md).

All images are from The (Arizona) Daily Wildcat student-run newspaper at The University of Arizona. The copyright holder of this content is therefore The Daily Wildcat, and they hold all rights to this content. I have obtained explicit permission to publish these online from the Editor-in-Chief of The Daily Wildcat through the Director of Arizona Student Media. The requirements for this republishing are to cite The (Arizona) Daily Wildcat (above) and the full date each was published (below).
