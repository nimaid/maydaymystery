# Personal HD Scans

These are scans I have personally taken from the bound and unbound archives of The (Arizona) Daily Wildcat in the Special Collections building in the University of Arizona library. I intend to upload the highest resolution I can obtain with the tools available to me at this time.

I have obtained explicity written permission to publish these online by the copyright holder, The Daily Wildcat. They know Bryan Hance, and generally approve of anything that may help in solving this mystery.
